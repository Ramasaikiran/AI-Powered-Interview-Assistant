 # How It Works

1. Candidate uploads a resume (PDF required, DOCX optional).
2. System extracts Name, Email, Phone. Missing fields are collected via chat.
3. The AI interview flow begins:

    6 questions (2 Easy â†’ 2 Medium â†’ 2 Hard).
    Timed per question (Easy: 20s, Medium: 60s, Hard: 120s).
    Auto-submits answers when time runs out.
4. AI calculates a final score and generates a summary.
5. Interviewer Dashboard shows:

    Candidate list ordered by score.
    Detailed profile, chat history, and AI evaluation.
    Search & sort functionality.
6. Progress is saved locally. If the session is interrupted, a Welcome Back modal restores state.
